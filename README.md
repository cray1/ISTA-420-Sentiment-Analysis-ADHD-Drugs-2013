The explosion of the social media website like Twitter, Google+, and Facebook poses 

a great potential for variety of research areas from targeted marketing to contagious 

disease capture. Twitter, as a microblogging platform, has enormous increasing 

number of user. On Twitter, users publish short messages using 140 or fewer 

characters to “tweet” about their opinion on various topics and to share information 

or have conversations with the follower. Often, a Twitter user would share health-

related information such as their medications and associated effects. Hence, we 

believe that Twitter can be a promising Internet based real time medication review 

platform. 

To goal of our project is to leverage the cyber infrastructure concept,

build a scalable analytical framework for extracting patient intelligence 

from Twitter messages, and present our result to patients, doctors, pharmacists and 

researchers in an understandable format. 

In creating the system for this project, we have consulted with both professional 

pharmacists, as well as students and professors of pharmacy to receive their 

consultation as to how to have the functionality best suit the needs of the 

community. Based upon the consultation we were given, we primarily focused upon 

a few specific factors. 

We limited our view of drugs for data based upon two points; we needed to select 

a drug that the patient base had a significant overlap with the primary user base 

for Twitter, and we needed to select a drug that is generally well-known and likely 

to be the topic of discussion. These criteria lead to us selecting Adderall, Vyvanse 

and Ritalin as the selected keywords for our process. Our process concatenates a 

live stream of the ‘tweets’ containing these key words into a database of all ‘tweets’ 

between all selected key words. 

Adderall, Vyvanse and Ritalin are common medications for Attention Deficit 

Disorder (ADD) patients. These medications have attracted attention of medical 

professionals because of their controversial effectiveness and abusive use. It is 

to their interest to listen to patients’ voices about these medications. Thus, we 

proposed to utilize text-mining techniques to classify the patients’ sentiment toward 

these three drugs and identify drug side effects and visualize the results in an 

understandable way.
